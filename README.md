# CV Builder
### [Check out the live demo](https://fedelopez17.github.io/cv-builder/) ðŸ”— ðŸ“„

## Description:
This project is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths)<br>
CV Builder allows users to generate a resume based on their input, customize its font and color palette, and then export it as a PDF file.<br>

## New things learned:
 - TypeScript<br>
I learned TypeScript through Scrimba courses, YouTube tutorials, and primarily, by following the official documentation, which is really good. Having experience with other typed languages in the past, learning the TypeScript fundamentals was relatively straightforward. However, I still have some learning to do regarding the more advanced concepts.

 - TailwindCSS<br>
Just like TypeScript's, Tailwind docs are great, so learning it was a smooth experience as well. I found housing the styles within components to be really convenient. It helped with the separation of concerns and made the workflow more efficient. I also enjoyed not having to come up with class names for HTML elements, although that can be solved using an approach like [BEM](https://getbem.com/).

## Thoughts on the project:
This is the second version of the project. The first version can be found in the branch called old-version. Originally written using class-based React, I had to rewrite it due to changes made to The Odin Project's curriculum and this specific assignment.<br>
I decided to seize this opportunity to incorporate two technologies I was looking forward to learning: TypeScript and Tailwind.<br>
I have mixed feelings about this project. Firstly, a demanding academic year and the update in The Odin Project's curriculum meant the project took much longer than expected. Furthermore, there are aspects of the project that could have been done much better. However, I find satisfaction in viewing it as a practice endeavor that successfully put my knowledge to the test. Moreover, I'm pleased that my coursework at University, focusing on design patterns and clean code, has enabled me to identify areas for improvement.<br>

There are a couple of known bugs that I will be fixing in the near future.
