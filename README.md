# CV Generator :page_facing_up: (Old Version)

### [Live demo](https://fedelopez17.github.io/weather-app)

## Description:

The project's name is pretty much self-explanatory, CV Generator allows users to generate a resume based on their input and then export it as a PDF file.<br>
Initially, it was part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). However, while I was working on it, The Odin Project's maintainers decided to update the React section of the course, migrating from Class Components to React Hooks. Thereby, this is just the first version. I decided to wrap it up rather prematurely and reserve the fine-tuning for the newer version.<br>
In relation to this newer version, I've made the decision to not only incorporate React Hooks, but also take the opportunity to integrate other technologies commonly used alongside React. Namely, TypeScript, ~~NextJS~~[^1] Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

[^1]: Opted out of using NextJS for this particular project after discussing it with more experienced colleagues.
